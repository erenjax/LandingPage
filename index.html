    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Using "title" you can now rate all your favorite songs, share your ratings, and share music.</p>

    <h2>7.5 Navigation Bars</h3>
        <p>You can create your own navigation bar (navbar):</p>
        <div id="navbar" class="navbar">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="html_sample.html#unordered-lists">Unordered Lists</a></li>
                <li><a href="html_sample.html#ordered-lists">Ordered Lists</a></li>
                <li><a href="html_sample_2.html">Our Second Page</a></li>
             </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Check the URL in your browser bar after you have clicked on Unordered
            Lists or Ordered Lists. You will see the specific # where you went. If 
            you click on Our Second Page the URL of that page will be shown.
        </p>

    <h2>6. Images</h2>
        <p>You can include images on your page as follows:</p>
        <img src="https://placeimg.com/400/200/any" alt="Here is the alt text.">

    <h2>5. Hyperlinks</h2>
    <div>
    <p>
        Hyperlinks, or links, are really what makes the web a network. The 
        html tag &lt;a&gt; specifies links and is short for anchor.
        Here is a relative link to a <a href="html_sample_2.html">second 
        page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also link to pages using the absolute path. For example, here 
        is <a href="https://sebastianzimmeck.de/class/comp333/comp333.html" 
        target="_blank">our class website</a>. Especially, in cases where you
        are leading the user away from your site it may be useful to open 
        the new page in a new tab using the HTML target property as we are 
        doing here. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another possiblity is to link to a particular id on a site, for 
        example, to the <a href="#white-div">div id above</a>. This type of 
        linking is called bookmarking. Use the pound sign in your href for 
        bookmarking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Links have different states. Originally, they are blue. But when you 
        clicked on a link, it will be in its visited state and will change 
        its color. You can also style links with CSS. However, apply styles 
        only in moderation to not confuse the user as to what is a link and 
        what not.
    </p>

    <h2>10. iframes</h2>
    <p>An iframe (inline frame) can be used to embed your other pages, 
    videos, or content that you load from third party pages. For example, 
    here is an iframe embedding another page. It can be styled as usual in 
    the Style Sheet.</p>
    <iframe src="html_sample_2.html" name="navframe"></iframe>
